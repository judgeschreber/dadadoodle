# dadadoodle
A web application that allows users to draw together, seeing what the other does in real time. Users can generate their own doodle-space and send an invite link to their friends. Due to responsive design and vanilla JavaScript adjusting aspect ratios, different screen sizes can be used for the doodle experience.

**_Waiting Animation_**

In dada-doodle-mode you draw together but you don't see what the other user draws. This requires 2 painters to join the fun. Until the second user joins, the first user sees a waiting animation. I created this animation of a randomly and infinitely drawn line using the JavaScript Canvas library p5.js.
